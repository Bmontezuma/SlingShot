# AR Slingshot Game üéØ

Welcome to the **AR Slingshot Game**! This project introduces you to the immersive world of Augmented Reality (AR) by blending digital interactions with real-world environments. Inspired by games like **Pok√©mon GO** and **AR HORSE**, this interactive experience allows you to detect horizontal planes (such as tables or floors), spawn moving targets, and launch projectiles to score points.

---

## üìú Project Overview

In this AR game, players select a real-world surface as their play area, upon which they can aim and launch projectiles at dynamically moving targets. This project serves as a foundational model for building interactive AR games and provides valuable hands-on experience with **Unity‚Äôs AR Foundation**, **ARKit**, and **ARCore**.

---

## üîß Technical Focus

### Key Learning Areas
This project covers three core areas:

1. **AR Fundamentals**  
   - Learn the basics of ARKit, ARCore, and ARFoundation.
   - Implement plane detection and anchoring in AR.

2. **AR Game Design**  
   - Design responsive UI for various mobile devices.
   - Develop AR interactions and mobile AR application deployment for both Android and iOS.

3. **AR Game Mechanics**  
   - Create a game mechanic that includes spawning moving targets, launching projectiles, and scoring.

By completing this project, you‚Äôll understand the end-to-end flow of an AR game, from plane detection to interactive gameplay.

## üìÇ Project Structure and Requirements

- **Unity Version**: Unity 2022 LTS
- **AR Plugins**: AR Foundation, ARKit XR Plugin, ARCore XR Plugin
- **Build Support**: Both Android and iOS platforms

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install Packages**  
   - Open Unity‚Äôs Package Manager and install:
     - AR Foundation
     - ARKit XR Plugin
     - ARCore XR Plugin
     - XR Plugin Management

2. **Scene Setup**  
   - Create a scene named `ARSlingshotGame`.
   - Add an **AR Session** and **AR Camera**.
   - Create an **AR Plane Manager** with the AR Plane Manager and AR Session Origin components to enable horizontal plane detection.

---

## üéÆ Gameplay Mechanics

### Plane Selection
- **Player Interaction**: Tap on a detected plane to select it.
- **Selected Plane**: Only one plane can be saved and used for gameplay, while others are discarded.
- **UI Prompt**: A **Start** button appears when a plane is selected.

### Target Spawning
- **Prefab**: A `Target` Capsule is instantiated as a prefab.
- **Positioning**: Targets are positioned on the selected plane and scale based on distance from the camera.
- **Movement**: Targets move randomly within the plane‚Äôs X/Z boundaries.

### Slingshot Mechanics
- **Projectile (Ammo)**: A Sphere named `Ammo` acts as the projectile.
- **Launch Controls**: Drag to aim and release to launch; the drag length determines launch force.
- **Gravity and Reset**: Ammo is affected by gravity and resets when it hits a target, plane, or goes out of bounds.

### UI Layout
- **Buttons**:
  - **Start**: Starts the game and initializes Ammo.
  - **Restart**: Resets the plane, score, Ammo, and targets.
  - **Quit**: Exits the game.
- **Score**: Updates based on targets hit; point value can vary with distance.
- **Ammo Counter**: Displays remaining Ammo, starting with 7.

### Replay Option
- **PlayAgainButton**: Appears when Ammo is depleted or all targets are eliminated, allowing the player to replay without changing the selected plane.

## üîç Tasks and Objectives

1. **Detect and Anchor Planes**
   - Detect horizontal planes, provide visual feedback, and anchor the detected plane.

2. **Select and Save Plane**
   - Enable plane selection, save the chosen plane, and discard others. Display a Start button upon selection.

3. **Spawn and Move Targets**
   - Create moving targets on the selected plane with constraints for scale and movement direction.

4. **Slingshot Functionality**
   - Implement drag-to-launch mechanics, including gravity, launch force based on drag length, and reset conditions.

5. **Responsive UI Setup**
   - Design a vertically aligned UI with buttons and counters that scales to various resolutions.

6. **Replay Mechanics**
   - Add a replay button to restart the game, retaining the selected plane.

7. **Trajectory Indicator**
   - Use a LineRenderer to visualize the launch trajectory for the Ammo.

8. **Build and Test**
   - Build the project for Android and iOS. Create a `.zip` of each build for distribution.
